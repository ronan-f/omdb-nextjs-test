This is quite possibly the greatest movie app in existence. It uses the [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) and doesn't really do anything as of yet but just wait and see. It's built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

### Getting Started

First, copy `.env.example` into a new file called .env.local and fill in the values, then run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### ORM

This project uses [Prisma](http://prisma.io/) as an ORM with a Postgres DB.

### Authentication

Auth is handled using [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).
